                    <p>I am a registered nurse and have worked many years in hospitals, clinics, and sales. Organization is key to efficient healthcare. But even prior to becoming a nurse, I loved to organize. My neighbors would hire me when I was a teenager
                        to come and organized their children’s rooms. I would help my mom clean and organize our home. My room was always the clean and organized one. Since my marriage 27 years ago, my husband and I have moved to various locations around
                        the country 12 times. Staying organized before, during, and after the moving process helped us acclimate much faster. It is difficult to get off to a good start if you cannot find your silverware. After having children, I learned
                        how keeping organized helped my children stay on task and be prepared for school and activities. I realize that lives change and organizational needs change along with it. New locations, new activities and new interests all require
                        shifts in organization. I would love to help others get organized to be able to feel that sense of peace and calm within their home.

                        Throughout my life my friends, family and employers have told me I’m neat, organized and efficient and these traits helped me to be more effective as a Pediatric nurse for 25 years. As my family moved several times over the last few years for my husband’s
                        career, including a move from Germany to California, I realized how helpful it has been to be organized. We downsized in Germany from a house to a condo and within California moved a few times. Being organized made it a lot easier.
                        With two grown children in college, I’ve helped them move annually. I realized that I love to organize and have a knack for it. After helping friends and relatives with moving, downsizing a residence, and setting up new households
                        and enjoying it, I decided to pursue organizing as a profession. I love to work with people and know how important it is to listen to what people need. No two situations are the same and my approach is always customized to a client’s
                        needs.
